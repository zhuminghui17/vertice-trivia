    const prompt = `Generate 5 challenging yet fair trivia questions for a daily quiz. Create questions that make people think, not just recall basic facts.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. DIFFICULTY: Medium-Hard (6/10 difficulty) - should challenge educated adults
2. CATEGORIES: Choose from these diverse categories:
   - Science & Technology (space, physics, biology, computing, innovations)
   - History & Politics (lesser-known events, historical figures, political systems)
   - Arts & Culture (literature, music, art movements, cultural phenomena)
   - Geography & Nature (unusual places, geological features, ecosystems)
   - Sports & Entertainment (records, behind-the-scenes facts, industry knowledge)
   - Current Events & Society (recent developments, social movements, economics)

3. QUESTION TYPES - Mix these styles:
   - Cause & Effect: "What phenomenon causes..." 
   - Lesser-known Facts: "Which country was the first to..."
   - Technical Details: "In computing, what does..."
   - Historical Context: "What event led to..."
   - Scientific Principles: "What happens when..."

4. AVOID these overused topics:
   - Capital cities of major countries (Tokyo, Paris, London, etc.)
   - Basic historical dates (1776, 1492, etc.)
   - Common scientific facts (speed of light, etc.)
   - Basic pop culture (Disney characters, etc.)

5. ANSWER OPTIONS:
   - Make all 4 options plausible to someone unfamiliar with the topic
   - Avoid obvious wrong answers
   - Include related but incorrect options that might confuse someone with partial knowledge

EXAMPLES of the quality I want:
- "What programming concept allows a function to call itself?"
- "Which treaty ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648?"
- "What element gives Neptune its distinctive blue color?"
- "In economics, what term describes the point where supply equals demand?"

Format as valid JSON array:
[
  {
    "question": "Your challenging question here",
    "options": ["Correct answer", "Plausible wrong 1", "Plausible wrong 2", "Plausible wrong 3"],
    "correctAnswer": "Correct answer",
    "category": "Specific category"
  }
]

Generate unique, thought-provoking questions that will genuinely challenge and educate players.`
